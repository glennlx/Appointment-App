App Being Developed for Wellcare Clinic, currently has the following requirements:

To Do For June 2nd for Pawan :

Add a layout / activity for Entering Phone Number and Submit OTP, after that Popup or reveal another EditText for Entering OTP.

That activity should open only if user opts to register using mobile number in the registration page.
